/*
25.Alien Colors #1: Imagine an alien was just shot down in a game. Create a variable
 called alien_color and assign it a value of 'green', 'yellow', or 'red'.

• Write an if statement to test whether the alien’s color is green. If it is,
 print a message that the player just earned 5 points.

• Write one version of this program that passes the if test and another that fails.
 (The version that fails will have no output.)

 //Version 1 (Passing the if test):
 let alien_color: string = 'green';

 if (alien_color === 'green') {
   console.log("Congratulations! You just earned 5 points.");
 }
 
//Version 2 (Failing the if test):
 let _alien_color: string = 'red';

if (_alien_color === 'green') {
  console.log("Congratulations! You just earned 5 points.");
}
